To practice HTML and CSS I tried to use one of free bootstrap templates as basis of design. This is not pixel perfect recreation, as template didn't serve the role of "psd" design, but rather a basis for my non-design eye, just to more or less copy it.

Menu is a bit weird, but I stayed commited to "no js" rule, and it uses some variations of hover/active selectors to simulate click (of course button has to stay pressed), but I think since the important point of this project is styling (not reactive functionality) it gets its point across.

No frameworks, no js, just pure html/css.

Scripts:

for final build (autoprefixer, optimizer etc)

```
npm run build
```

for Webpack dev server:

```
npm run start
```
